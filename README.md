# My Body Back

**An MVP built as part of the Founders & coders' Tech for Better programme in October 2019**

The app aims to provide support for people with experience of sexual assault. The app will encourage more people to go for a routince cervical screening (smear test).

This project was brought to Founders and Coders by Jane Smallwood who is conducting research as part of her PhD at Royal Holloway, University of London.

This project relies on Jane's research and [My Body Back.](http://www.mybodybackproject.com)

### Design Sprint 

This is when we defined our main [user journey](https://github.com/fac-17/My-Body-Back/wiki/User-Journey) and [user stories](https://github.com/fac-17/My-Body-Back/wiki/User-Stories) as well as running user testing and collating feedback to adjust our approach. We had several iterations of our prototype build with Figma after receiving both peer and user feedback.
